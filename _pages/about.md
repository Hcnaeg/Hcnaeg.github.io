## About Me

I am a final-year Master's student at [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/), where I have been fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Gong Cheng](http://ws.nju.edu.cn/~gcheng). I earned my Bachelor's degree from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/) in 2022.

I am excited to begin my Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/) in Fall 2025, under the supervision of [Prof. Ziyi Huang](https://siyi-huang.github.io/).

My research interests are in the mathematical and statistical principles, including foundational biostatistical theory and the development of rigorous mathematical methods.
